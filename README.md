# Spam_Mail_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning
Machine Learning project for predicting spam emails using the Logistic Regression mode

# Overview
This GitHub repository hosts a machine learning project for predicting spam emails using the Logistic Regression model. Spam emails are a persistent problem in our digital communication landscape, and this project aims to provide a solution for automatically identifying and filtering out unwanted emails.

# Key Features
1. Implementation of Logistic Regression, a powerful classification algorithm, for spam detection.
2. Text preprocessing and feature extraction to convert email content into usable features.
3. Evaluation metrics for assessing model accuracy and performance.
4. User-friendly Jupyter Notebook for easy exploration and understanding of the project.
5 Sample datasets for training and testing.
6. Well-documented code with detailed explanations.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains email samples categorized as either spam or ham (non-spam). It includes features such as email content, sender information, and more. These attributes are used to train and test the Logistic Regression model for spam detection.
